# Neural_StyleTransfer_CNN
# 🎨 Neural Style Transfer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 🎨

## Overview 🔍🌟🗺
This project explores the advanced implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST) for artistic image synthesis. By leveraging pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the method combines the structural elements of a content image with the stylistic attributes of a reference image using the VGG-19 architecture, resulting in visually captivating compositions.

## Features 🔟🎨🌀
- **Content Representation**: Encodes the structural and spatial attributes of the input image.
- **Style Representation**: Captures the intricate patterns, textures, and chromatic characteristics of the reference image.
- **Output Generation**: Synthesizes a novel image by harmonizing content and style through iterative optimization.

## Methodology 🌍🔄⚙️

### Key Steps 📜
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - 📷 Images are loaded and preprocessed, ensuring compatibility with the model.
   - 📊 Resizing operations standardize dimensions to 400x400 pixels for computational efficiency.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - 🔄 Deeper layers of VGG-19 extract semantic content representations.
   - 🎨 Shallow layers generate style representations using Gram matrices to capture texture correlations.

3. **Loss Functions**:
   - **Content Loss**: Quantifies deviations between the generated image and content image in terms of high-level feature representations.
   - **Style Loss**: Employs Gram matrices to measure deviations in stylistic coherence between the generated and style images.

4. **Optimization**:
   - ⚙️ The Adam optimizer iteratively refines the generated image to minimize the combined loss function.
   - 📈 Adjustable weight parameters facilitate the balance between content fidelity and stylistic influence.
